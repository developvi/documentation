Site Groups, just like Server Groups, provide a way to tag sites that are somehow logically related. For example, you can assign some sites to the “Production” group and others to a “Dev” group. You can create your own groups but we ship the plugin with a few groups already created.

Once sites are assigned to groups you can sort and filter the server list using the group attribute. With a single click you can filter the entire site list to show just the “Production” sites.

## Create A New Application (Site) Group

*   Go to WPCloud Deploy->Applications->App Groups
*   Fill in the Name of the new group in the form on the left side of the screen
*   Assign it a new color
*   Click on the _Add New App Group_ button.

## Assign A Group To An App (Site)

Assigning a group to a server is simple:

*   Go to WPCloud Deploy->Applications->Applications
*   Click on the app (site) for which this action will apply
*   On the right hand side of the screen you’ll see a _App Group_ box – you can check the group(s) that this site beongs to.
*   Click the _Update_ button on the top right of the screen to save your selections.

## Filter The App (Site) List By Group

To see all the sites in the app list that belongs to a particular group:

*   Go to WPCloud Deploy->Applications->Applications
*   In the filter bar at the top of the screen you’ll see a drop-down for _App Groups_. Click that and select a group.
*   Click the _Filter_ button on the right of the filter bar.

Alternatively, you can click any App Group in the App Group column and the application list will immediately filter to show apps with just that group.
