White Labeling in DVI is not like the White Label service you might see at other companies such as WPENGINE, FLYWHEEL etc.

We start off by offering an area on our settings screen that allow you to do the basics – remove logo, change colors etc:

But, unlike other SaaS hosting services you can go deeper because DVI is a WP plugin – and many of the WP white label and customization plugins as well as WP action hooks and filters can be used.

To get deeper into the customization process, here are some ‘off-the-shelf’ tools you can use:

*   Standard WordPress translation tools such as POEDIT to either deploy DVI in your own language or just to change the terms on the screen.
*   [Admin Menu Editor Pro](https://web.archive.org/web/20240529161012/https://adminmenueditor.com/) to further add/remove menu items – we remove items not suitable for a user level but you might want to remove others.
*   A WPADMIN theme such as SLATE or THEMEPASSION to provide a different WP-ADMIN look to your clients

Check out [wpcd.cloud](https://web.archive.org/web/20240529161012/https://wpcd.cloud|/) and [wpcloudpanel.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20240529161012/https://wpcloudpanel.com/) to see some simple things that we did to provide a different ‘look’ for DVI.

If you’re a developer, you can use WP action hooks and filters as well as wpcd-specific action hooks and filters. You can also create your own plugins that extend DVI and use custom CSS on any of the DVI pages.

_If you do find things that need to be hidden for a white label deployment please let us know – sometimes we miss things that should be placed behind a wp-config.php entry or run through a custom WP filter hook._

And, of course, the ultimate in customization options is the option to delve into the DVI code yourself and tear things apart if you wish – everything is open-source.
