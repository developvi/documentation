Server groups provide a way to tag servers that are somehow logically related. For example, you can assign some servers to the “Production” group and others to a “Dev” group. You can create your own groups but we ship the plugin with a few groups already created.

Once servers are assigned to groups you can sort and filter the server list using the group attribute. With a single click you can filter the entire server list to show just the “Production” servers.

## Create A New Server Group

*   Go to WPCloud Deploy->Applications->Server Groups
*   Fill in the Name of the new group in the form on the left side of the screen
*   Assign it a new color
*   Click on the _Add New Cloud Server Group_ button.

## Assign A Group To A Server

Assigning a group to a server is simple:

*   Go to WPCloud Deploy->Applications->All Cloud Servers
*   Click on the server for which this action will apply
*   On the right hand side of the screen you’ll see a _Cloud Server Group_ box – you can check the group(s) that this server belongs to.
*   Click the _Update_ button on the top right of the screen to save your selections.

## Filter The Server List By Group

To see all the servers in the server list that belongs to a particular group:

*   Go to WPCloud Deploy->Applications->All Cloud Servers
*   In the filter bar at the top of the screen you’ll see a drop-down for _Server Groups_. Click that and select a group.
*   Click the _Filter_ button on the right of the filter bar.

Alternatively, you can click any server group in the server group column and the server list will immediately filter to show servers with just that group.
