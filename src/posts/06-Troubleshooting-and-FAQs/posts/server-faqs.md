### What is the difference between the DEPLOY A NEW SERVER and ADD NEW RECORD button?

*   **Deploy A New Server** will deploy a new server at your designated server provider.
*   **Add New Record** simply allows you to add a new record to the server list but does not necessarily connect it to any physical server at a cloud provider.

There is rarely ever a need to use the ADD NEW RECORD button. If you find yourself in a situation where our tech support staff needs to use it, it probably means that you accidentally deleted a server record and it needs to be recreated. Then all your sites are going to need to be re-linked to the new server record.
