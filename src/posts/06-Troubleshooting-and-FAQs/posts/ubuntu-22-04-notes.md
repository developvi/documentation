DVI includes full support for Ubuntu 22.04 with both the NGINX & OpenLiteSpeed web servers.

## Installation

To install Ubuntu 22.04 with a new server use the drop-down option on the server deployment screen:

## Global Settings

There is an option in SETTINGS to make older versions of Ubuntu the default in the settings area:

And, as you can see in the above image, you have options to disable the various Ubuntu versions so that they are not available as an option during server deployment.

**Ubuntu 22.04 is the default version for all new DVI installations unless you specify otherwise.**
