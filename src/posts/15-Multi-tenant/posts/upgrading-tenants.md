As you create new versions of your templates, you will eventually want to upgrade your existing tenants.

You can do this on the Multi-tenant tab for the template.

## Upgrade Multiple Tenants

*   Navigate to the template site detail screen
*   Click on the **Multi-tenant** tab
*   Scroll down to the **UPGRADE TENANTS** section
*   For the _Upgrade Tenants To This Version_ field, select the version that tenants will be upgraded to
*   To upgrade all tenants, click the **UPGRADE ALL TENANTS** button
*   To upgrade a subset of tenants, select one of the other options and click the related **UPGRADE** button.

## Upgrade A Single Tenant

To upgrade a single tenant:

*   Navigate to the tenant site detail screen
*   Click on the **Multi-tenant** tab
*   In the **UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE** section, enter the new version you will be upgrading the tenant to (the default version will be the current version the tenant is running)
*   Click the **APPLY NEW VERSION** button.
