Do you find yourself constantly Googling the attributes of the WordPress Post Object?

Is it **$post->title** or **$post->post\_title**?

Why does **$post->id** return nothing? Oh, right, because it’s one of the attributes that’s capitalized so it should be **$post->ID**.

Well, bookmark this link and search no longer:

public 'ID' => int
public 'post\_author' => string
public 'post\_date' => string
public 'post\_date\_gmt' => string
public 'post\_content' => string
public 'post\_title' => string
public 'post\_excerpt' => string
public 'post\_status' => string
public 'comment\_status' => string
public 'ping\_status' => string
public 'post\_password' => string
public 'post\_name' => string
public 'to\_ping' => string
public 'pinged' => string
public 'post\_modified' => string
public 'post\_modified\_gmt' => string
public 'post\_content\_filtered' => string
public 'post\_parent' => int
public 'guid' => string
public 'menu\_order' => int
public 'post\_type' => string
public 'post\_mime\_type' => string
public 'comment\_count' => string
public 'filter' => string

[WordPress Documentation on the WP\_POST object](https://web.archive.org/web/20240420015625/https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_post/) – you’ll need to dig into the code shown there. Not quite sure why they didn’t list these fields out there. But that’s WP docs for you.
