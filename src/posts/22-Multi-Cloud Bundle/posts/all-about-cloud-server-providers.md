Most providers just require an API key and an ssh key-pair to get started. Some of them, such as VULTR, require that you explicitly turn on API access and white-list IP addresses. Others, such as AWS, AZURE & GOOGLE are much more complex to set up.

Regardless, the most important part about configuring a provider is creating and uploading ssh public-private keypairs.
