*   Click on the **GIT** tab
*   Click on the **INSTALL GIT** button.

## Setup Server-Wide Default Credentials

If you want all your sites on the server to use the same set of credentials but these credentials are different from the global ones, you can set them up under the GIT tab. These options will show up once GIT is installed.
