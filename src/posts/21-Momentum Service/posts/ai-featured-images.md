DevelopVIDeploy Momentum includes a custom post type for SERVICES. If used, your customer can create a list of services when completing the onboarding form:

We use AI to expand and cleanup the service descriptions that your customer provides.

Those descriptions are also used to generate images for each service.

You can use a “POST LOOP” block to display the services on a page. For example:

[![](https://web.archive.org/web/20240420011913im_/https://wpclouddeploy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wpcd-momentum-services-03.png)](https://web.archive.org/web/20240420011913/https://wpclouddeploy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wpcd-momentum-services-03.png)

Each image will be generated using an AI prompt such as the following:

_A professional image for a service titled {{custom\_service\_title}}. The image should relate to the {{dvi\_industry}} industry. For context, here is some background information about the company: {{about\_company}} whose website the image will go on and additional information about the service: {{custom\_service\_details}}._

You can customize this prompt by navigating to the **AI PROMPTS** → **ALL PROMPTS** page and editing the item with the title **Featured image for a custom service page**.
