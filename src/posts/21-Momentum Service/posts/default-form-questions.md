The default installation of **DevelopVIDeploy Momentum** includes the following questions in the onboarding form. The answers to these questions help power the AI prompts used to pre-populate the contents for the new customer site as well as inject some of the answers into certain pages.

*   What is the name of your company?
*   What is your email address?
*   Please tell us about your company
*   What makes your company different?
*   Current website/domain
*   Upload Logo
*   Choose a primary color
*   Choose a secondary color
*   Phone
*   Address
*   Operating hours summary
*   Operating hours detail (day-by-day hours of operation)
*   Services and description offered
*   Completed projects and descriptions
*   Testimonials
*   Social media profile links
*   How many years have you been in business?
*   How many projects have you completed?
*   Number of staff
*   Founder name
*   Year company was started
*   Final comments and requests

Here is what the default form looks like:

Eagle-eyed users will recognize the style as the ORBITAL theme used in Gravity Forms. The onboarding form is a Gravity Form which makes changing the form a lot easier than if it was created in code.
