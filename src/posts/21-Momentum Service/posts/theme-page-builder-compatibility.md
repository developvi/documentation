The default configuration of DevelopVIDeploy Momentum includes compatibility with the following themes and page builders:

*   Beaver Builder
*   Kadence
*   WordPress Blocks & Site Editor (Gutenberg)

Most other themes and page builders should work as long as content and image links are stored in a textual human-readable format in the database.

However, we know that ELEMENTOR does NOT work because it stores page and post content in a non-standard format that cannot be searched or replaced using a pure text search.

You should also review the limitations on AI generated images in the [AI IMAGES](https://web.archive.org/web/20240420000822/https://wpclouddeploy.com/documentation/momentum/custom-ai-images/) documentation â€“ see the IMPORTANT NOTES section towards the bottom of the page.

Of course, since MOMENTUM is a **PRODUCTIZED SERVICE** that we expect will be customized for each customer, we can create compatibility with almost any theme or page builder.
