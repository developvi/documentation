Powertools is a DVI add-on that provides functions that might only be of interest to a subset of our users. In version 1.0.0 we include three primary functions:

*   [Dashboards](https://web.archive.org/web/20240420012757/https://wpclouddeploy.com/documentation/powertools/dashboard/)
*   [Scheduled Snapshots](https://web.archive.org/web/20240420012757/https://wpclouddeploy.com/documentation/powertools/scheduled-snapshots/)
*   [Netdata Integration](https://web.archive.org/web/20240420012757/https://wpclouddeploy.com/documentation/powertools/netdata-integration/)

In version 2.0.0 we added the following:

*   [Recurring Site Images](https://web.archive.org/web/20240420012757/https://wpclouddeploy.com/documentation/powertools/recurring-site-images/)
*   [Home Page Images](https://web.archive.org/web/20240420012757/https://wpclouddeploy.com/documentation/powertools/home-page-images/)
*   [Run Callbacks More Frequently (or on a Different Schedule)](https://web.archive.org/web/20240420012757/https://wpclouddeploy.com/documentation/powertools/run-callbacks-more-frequently/)
*   [Automatic Backups On A Different Schedule](https://web.archive.org/web/20240420012757/https://wpclouddeploy.com/documentation/powertools/automatic-backups-on-a-different-schedule/)

As the name “Powertools” might suggest, more resources is recommended when using these features. A VM with at least two cores and 2 GB of memory is strongly suggested.
