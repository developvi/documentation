Before a user can be added to a team, they need to be granted the [custom DVI WordPress capabilities](https://web.archive.org/web/20240419235801/https://wpclouddeploy.com/documentation/wpcloud-deploy-teams/roles-and-capabilities/) that were created when the plugin was installed.

The easiest way to do that is to change the user’s role. We provide 4 default roles that are listed [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240419235801/https://wpclouddeploy.com/documentation/wpcloud-deploy-teams/roles-and-capabilities/).

If you don’t want to change your users’ role, you can add our custom capabilities to their existing roles instead. You can do this using a plugin such as USER ROLE EDITOR.

The list of capabilities and what they mean are located [here.](https://web.archive.org/web/20240419235801/https://wpclouddeploy.com/documentation/wpcloud-deploy-teams/roles-and-capabilities/)
