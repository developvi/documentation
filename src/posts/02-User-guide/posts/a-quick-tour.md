After installation of the WPCloud Deploy plugin is complete you will find a new menu option in your WordPress site named _WPCloud Deploy_. Under there will be the following menu items:

*  **Cloud Servers**: This is your list of servers and where you can add a new server.
*  **Server Groups**: Create labels for server groups. You can assign servers these labels and then sort and filter the server list with them.
*  **WordPress Sites**: This is your list of WordPress sites.
*  **Settings**: This is where you will configure your server providers and setup your associated API keys and private SSH keys.
*  **Applications**: This is a list of all apps which can include both WordPress sites and apps that are not related to WordPress.
*  **App Groups**: Create labels for your WordPress sites. You can assign sites these labels and then sort and filter the app list with them.
*  **Teams**: This is where you can lock down servers and sites to particular users. Create a team and assign users and associated permissions to the team. Later you can assign the team to servers and sites.
*  **Command Log:** This is the log output for “long running” commands that are sent to a server.
*  **SSH Log:** This is the log out for quick-running commands that are sent to a server.
*  **Error Log**: You can configure error log output on the SETTINGS screen. If you have done so, this is where you can view those logs.
*  **Pending Tasks:** Certain operations can be performed in the background. These are tracked and handled on this screen.
*  **Server Alerts:** Set up email and other notifications when significant events happen on your server.
*  **Permission List**: This is a list of permissions that can be assigned to users on a team. 99% of the time you do not need to do anything in this screen. Note that, depending on an entry in your config.php file, this option might not be shown.
