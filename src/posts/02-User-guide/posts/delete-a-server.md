To Delete A Server:

*  Navigate to **DevelopVIDeploy** → **Cloud Servers**
*  Scroll down to the server you want to delete
*  Hover over the server name until a set of links appear
*  Click on the **TRASH** link

Please note that in almost all instances when you delete a server, it will be deleted at the Cloud Provider as well – you will lose all data and sites on the server!

You have the option to delete just the server record without removing the server at your Cloud Provider:

*  Navigate to **DevelopVIDeploy** → **Cloud Servers**
*  Scroll down to the server you want to delete
*  Hover over the server name until a set of links appear
*  Click on the **DELETE RECORD** link

### Enable Accidental Deletion Protection

You can prevent a server from being deleted accidentally by removing all delete links. To do this:

*  Navigate to **DevelopVIDeploy** → **Cloud Servers**
*  Scroll down to the server you want to protect
*  Click on the server name link to go to the server detail screen
*  In the right hand column you will see a box for **SERVER DELETE PROTECTION** – enable the checkbox in it
*  Click the **UPDATE** button at the top right of the screen
