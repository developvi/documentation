To Delete A Site:

*  Navigate to DevelopVIDeploy → All Apps
*  Scroll down to the site you want to delete
*  Hover over the domain/site name until a set of links appear
*  Click on the **REMOVE SITE** link (NOT the TRASH link!)

You have the option to delete just the site record without removing the site from the server.

*  Navigate to DevelopVIDeploy → All Apps
*  Scroll down to the site you want to delete
*  Hover over the domain / site name until a set of links appear
*  Click on the **TRASH** link

When you delete just the site record the site data will not be removed from the server and the site will still be accessible from a visitors browser; however you will no longer be able to manage it from inside DVI.

### Enable Accidental Deletion Protection

You can prevent a site from being deleted accidentally by removing all delete links. To do this:

*  Navigate to DevelopVIDeploy → All Apps
*  Scroll down to the site you want to protect
*  Click on the domain / site name link to go to the site detail screen
*  In the right hand column you will see a box for **APP DELETE PROTECTION** – enable the checkbox in it
*  Click the **UPDATE** button at the top right of the screen
