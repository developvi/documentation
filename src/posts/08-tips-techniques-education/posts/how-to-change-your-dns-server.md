## Introduction

When we deploy a server, we use the default DNS setup by the server provider. For example, in the case of VULTR, their DNS server might be something like 127.0.0.53.

However, you might want to use a different DNS resolver â€“ either for privacy, speed, redundancy or because the default DNS server is having issues.

## How To Do It

The data for the DNS resolver is in the _/etc/resolv.conf_ file.

Open the file in the NANO editor:

sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf

Somewhere in that file you should see at least one line that starts with the term _nameserver_ followed by an ip address:

Just before that line, add your own resolver. For example:

You can add as many resolvers as you like. They will be evaluated in the order listed. For example:

When you ready to save the file:

ctrl-o

Enter

Exit:

ctrl-x

The settings take effect immediately and there should be no need to restart the server.
