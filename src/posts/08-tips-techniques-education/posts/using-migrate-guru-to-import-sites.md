Importing sites isn’t exactly the most trivial process. So most of the time we recommend using [UPDRAFT PLUS for migrations and importing](https://web.archive.org/web/20240304154725/https://wpclouddeploy.com/documentation/tips-techniques-education/import-sites/) – it’s a rock solid tool for the task.

But, if you’re looking for a slightly more user-friendly tool, take a look at MIGRATE GURU – it’s a free service from folks over at BlogVault.
