do_action( "wpcd_server_{$this->get_app_name()}_{$name}_command_done", $id )

### Example Hook

add_action( "wpcd_server_wordpress-app_prepare_server_command_done", 'my_function', 10, 1 );
public function my_function( $id ){
      //your code here
}


### Discussion

This hook is fired after we have installed our software stack on the server and the server provisioning is complete.

At this point the server is stable and you should be able to connect to it.

*   **$id** is the post_id of the server or app custom post type record.

_**This hook might fire more than once so make sure you guard against that possibility in your code.**_

### Reference

Located in:

*   Function: _is_command_done_
*   File: _/includes/core/apps/class-wpcd-app.php_

### Availability

_This hook is only available in DVI versions 4.2.5 or later._
