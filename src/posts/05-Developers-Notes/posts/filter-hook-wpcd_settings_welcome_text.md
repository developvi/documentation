The first tab on the settings screen is the welcome tab and it shows a welcome message at the very top. You can replace this message using this filter.

It is slightly different from the _[wpcd_settings_welcome_text_initial](https://web.archive.org/web/20240420012712/https://wpclouddeploy.com/documentation/wpcloud-deploy-dev-notes/filter-hook-wpcd_settings_welcome_text_initial/)_ filter in that this text is always shown regardless of the setting of the wpcd_SKIP_WELCOME_MESSAGE entry in wp-config.
