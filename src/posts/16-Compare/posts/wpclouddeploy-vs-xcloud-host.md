## What Is xCloud.Host?

[xCloud.Host](https://web.archive.org/web/20240420011903/https://xcloud.host/) is a new (released in Jan 2024) SaaS service where you can deploy and manage your own WordPress servers and sites. It has direct connections to multiple cloud server providers that make provisioning servers fast and easy.

It is partially funded by the folks who publish the well regarded FLUENT series of WordPress plugin which include FLUENT CRM, FLUENT FORMS, FLUENT SMTP, FLUENT BOOKING and more.

## DevelopVIDeploy VS xCloud.Host: Similarities

Both DevelopVIDeploy and xCloud.Host allow you to deploy and manage your own WordPress servers that are optimized for building and managing WordPress sites. All the key WordPress management tools are available in both offerings including:

*   Server Provisioning
*   Site Provisioning
*   Site cloning
*   Free SSL Certificates via LetsEncrypt
*   Changing Domains
*   Staging Sites
*   Site Backups
*   Moving sites between servers
*   WP-CLI
*   and much more…

While there are a lot of tiny differences between how similar features work, both products are 100% focused on WordPress to the exclusion of other technology stacks and therefore both are highly optimized for that platform.

## DevelopVIDeploy VS xCloud.Host: Key Differences

There are four key differences between DevelopVIDeploy and xCloud.Host:

1.  **DevelopVIDeploy is a self-hosted product:** While xCloud.Host is hosted and managed in the “cloud’ on your behalf, you run DevelopVIDeploy on your own servers. This means that no staff member at DevelopVIDeploy will ever have access to your servers and sites unless you affirmatively grant them that access via a support request.
2.  **DevelopVIDeploy is built on WordPress:** This makes it instantly familiar to any experienced WordPress user. And you install it the same way you install any other WordPress product extension – as a plugin.
3.  **SaaS Builder Features:** xCloud.Host does not have many features that are specifically geared towards helping SaaS builders develop, configure, deploy and manage a SaaS on WordPress. DevelopVIDeploy has many features that were developed specifically in response to the needs of SaaS builders – for example, tight WooCommerce integration, Site Update Packages, multiple deployment options (standard sites and multi-tenant sites) etc.
4.  **Open-source:** DevelopVIDeploy is 100% open-source and [available on Github](https://web.archive.org/web/20240420011903/https://github.com/DevelopVIDeploy) – you can see exactly what you’re installing and audit the code at any time. If security and transparency is your jam then DevelopVIDeploy is probably the tool you want to use.

## Customization Options

Since xCloud.Host is an SaaS service, you are locked into a small set of personalization options. We do not know if they entertain requests for customization.

Because DevelopVIDeploy is an open source product built on WordPress, the sky’s the limit when it comes to customizations and you have a lot of flexibility in how those are accomplished. You can:

*   Customize the existing code by forking it into a new codebase
*   Extend it using the WordPress extension model (plugins)
*   Combine it with other WordPress plugins

As an experienced WordPress developer or manager, you can do many of the customizations yourself. Or you can ask any other WP developer to do the work for you. Or you can ask us of course.

## Language & Locale Options

As with your customization options, xCloud.Host is limited in the languages that can be used.

DevelopVIDeploy can adopt any language you like simply by providing the translation terms using any of the many standard WP translation tools.

## Deployment Options

As with any SaaS service, your dashboard is running wherever xCloud.Host determines is best.

DevelopVIDeploy can be run on any appropriately configured server anywhere and [can be installed in multiple locations if necessary](https://web.archive.org/web/20240420011903/https://wpclouddeploy.com/deployment-scenarios-for-wpclouddeploy/). With this flexibility you can:

*   Setup a dashboard for a specific set of customers.
*   Setup multiple management dashboards for each legal jurisdiction in which you operate.
*   Even build your own “xCloud.Host” lite service if you like.

## Server Providers

xCloud.Host has direct support for three server providers plus the ability to bring your own server. (As the service matures we fully expect support for the number of direct providers to increase.)

DevelopVIDeploy has built-in support for 12 providers (10 public cloud providers & 2 private cloud providers) as well as ability to “bring your own server”.

DevelopVIDeploy also has an extension toolkit where you can build your own provider. Or you can ask to have one built for you at a cost of around 3K (for providers that generally follow the openstack api style format.)

## Command Line Options

xCloud.Host has limited command line support.

DevelopVIDeploy uses Bash scripts that you can execute in either of two ways:

*   As a menu driven program – run the script, pick from a set of menu options and get an interactive q&a session that guides you through command completion
*   Can be run unattended by setting environment variables

## DevelopVIDeploy VS xCloud.Host: Other Relevant Differences

Sites deployed on xCloud.Host uses a single optimized LEMP stack.

DevelopVIDeploy supports both a LEMP stack (Linux, NGINX, MySql/MariaDB, PHP) and a LOMP stack (Linux, OpenLiteSpeed, MySql/MariaDB, PHP).

As a SaaS service it is far easier to get started with xCloud.Host. DevelopVIDeploy has an installation step that can sometimes be tricky (hence our free install service when you purchase a license.)

Consistent with SaaS services, the xCloud.Host UI is custom-made and absolutely gorgeous – even better than SpinupWP which is one that we have admired in the past.

In contrast, DevelopVIDeploy’s UI is recognizably WordPress on the backend with a highly customized UI for your end customers on the front-end.

## Pricing

Both DevelopVIDeploy and xCloud.Host offer tired pricing levels. xCloud.Host offers four pricing levels while DevelopVIDeploy offers three (plus a free option).

xCloud.Host also offer “managed servers” where they handle all of the server components while you are focused on just site issues. This is a similar model to CloudWays.

At the time of this writing, xCloud.Host is running a limited time offer on lifetime licenses. Lifetime licenses are expected to disappear shortly.

## Converting From xCloud.Host to DevelopVIDeploy

You can transfer your sites using any WordPress backup tool. We recommend UPDRAFT PLUS though many folks seem to prefer using DUPLICATOR PRO (something we’re far less familiar with).

## Other

The above summary is only focused on the product differences and similarities. There are, of course, differences between the companies themselves – including large differences in operations, pricing, support policies, affiliate programs and more.

## Bottom Line

If you’re looking for a SaaS style product to manage your WordPress business you should look at [GridPane](https://web.archive.org/web/20240420011903/https://wpclouddeploy.com/documentation/compare-wpclouddeploy-to/wpclouddeploy-vs-gridpane/) or [SpinpupWP](https://web.archive.org/web/20240420011903/https://wpclouddeploy.com/documentation/compare-wpclouddeploy-to/wpclouddeploy-vs-spinupwp/) – unless you have other product stacks you need to support. Choose xCloud.Host if you’re willing to deal with unexpected challenges that usually accompany new products. We suspect that within a year, this product will be a force to reckon, easily giving SaaS services such as GridPane and SpinupWP a run for their money.

Obviously, for a self-hosted, privacy-focused, feature-packed product, choose DevelopVIDeploy.
