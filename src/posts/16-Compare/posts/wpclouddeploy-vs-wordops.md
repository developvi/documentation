## What Is WordOps

[WordOps](https://web.archive.org/web/20240304160121/https://wordops.net/) is an opensource command-line tool used for creating optimized webservers for WordPress. It can be used on any server at any provider or hosting service – as long as it meets the minimum WordOps requirements.

## DevelopVIDeploy VS WordOps: Similarities

Both DevelopVIDeploy and WordOps allow you to deploy optimized WordPress servers. All the key WordPress management tools are available in both offerings including:

*   Server Provisioning (WordOps is a manual process)
*   Site Provisioning
*   Site cloning
*   Free SSL Certificates via LetsEncrypt
*   Changing Domains
*   and much more…

Additionally, both DevelopVIDeploy and WordOps are open-source products available on Github.

## DevelopVIDeploy VS WordOps: Key Differences

There are four key differences between DevelopVIDeploy and WordOps:

1.  **DevelopVIDeploy is a dashboard:** While WordOps is a command line tool, DevelopVIDeploy provides a full GUI to manage your end-to-end WordPress infrastructure.
2.  **DevelopVIDeploy is built on WordPress:** This makes it instantly familiar to any experienced WordPress user. And you install it the same way you install any other WordPress product extension – as a plugin.
3.  **SaaS Builder Features:** WordOps does not have many features that are specifically geared towards helping SaaS builders develop, configure, deploy and manage a SaaS on WordPress. DevelopVIDeploy has many features that were developed specifically in response to the needs of SaaS builders – for example, tight WooCommerce integration, Site Update Packages, multiple deployment options (standard sites and multi-tenant sites) etc.
4.  **Extensive functions in DevelopVIDeploy :** DevelopVIDeploy has far more functionality than is available in WordOps. WordOps is narrowly focused on using the command line to install and run WordPress sites. In addition to those functions DevelopVIDeploy is also able to run major portions of your WordPress business including your shop and certain CRM operations.

## Customization Options

Because both DevelopVIDeploy and WordOps are open-source products, they offer similar advantages when it comes to customization.

*   Both tools allow you to customize the existing code by forking it into a new codebase
*   Only DVI allows for extensions using the WordPress extension model (plugins)
*   Only DVI allows for extensions that include other WordPress plugins.

As an experienced WordPress developer or manager, you can do many of the DVI customizations yourself. Or you can ask any other WP developer to do the work for you. Or you can ask us of course.

## Language & Locale Options

Since WordOps is command line driven and your customers might never see it, only English is supported for interaction.

DevelopVIDeploy can adopt any language you need for your customer interactions, simply by providing the translation terms using any of the many standard WP translation tools.

## Server Providers

WordOps does not have any direct support server providers – it’s all _bring your own server_ style.

DevelopVIDeploy has built-in support for 12 providers (10 public cloud providers & 2 private cloud providers) as well as ability to “bring your own server”.

DevelopVIDeploy also has an extension toolkit where you can build your own provider. Or you can ask to have one built for you at a cost of around 3K (for providers that generally follow the openstack api style format.)

## Command Line Options

WordOps is all about the command line – EVERYTHING is driven from the command line.

DevelopVIDeploy uses Bash scripts that you can execute in either of two ways:

*   As a menu driven program – run the script, pick from a set of menu options and get an interactive q&a session that guides you through command completion
*   Can be run unattended by setting environment variables

## DevelopVIDeploy VS WordOps: Other Relevant Differences

Sites deployed on WordOps uses a LEMP stack that is fully optimized for WordPress. It also includes integrations to multiple DNS services.

DevelopVIDeploy supports both a LEMP stack (Linux, NGINX, MySql/MariaDB, PHP) and a LOMP stack (Linux, OpenLiteSpeed, MySql/MariaDB, PHP).

## Pricing

WordOps is 100% free – it has no premium tier (yet).

DevelopVIDeploy offers multiple tired pricing levels, including a free tier. It charges a single annual fee or lifetime fee with no monthly fee option.

## Converting From WordOps to DevelopVIDeploy

You can transfer your sites using any WordPress backup tool. We recommend UPDRAFT PLUS though many folks seem to prefer using DUPLICATOR PRO (something we’re far less familiar with).
