## Introduction

We have prebuilt a server image on the AWS marketplace that you can use to quickly create a WordPress server & site with DevelopVIDeploy already pre-installed.

You will need some basic SSH skills to be able to log into the server and follow the prompts so you can connect your domain and setup DVI.

[Launch DVI Server on AWS EC2](https://web.archive.org/web/20240420002439/https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-bhiab32pkw5ms)

After navigating to the AWS Marketplace page with the above button, please click the **CONTINUE TO SUBSCRIBE** button to get started.

When using this option, you have a few choices during the process:

*   Connect to your DigitalOcean Cloud with our DigitalOcean Wizard (even though youâ€™re launching DVI inside EC2)
*   Connect to your EC2 or other premium server provider account using a lengthier quick-start process (requires a DVI Premium Subscription)
