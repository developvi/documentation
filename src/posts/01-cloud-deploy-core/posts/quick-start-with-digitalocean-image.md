## Introduction

We have prebuilt a server image on the DigitalOcean marketplace that you can use to quickly deploy a server & site with DevelopVIDeploy already pre-installed.

You will need some basic SSH skills to be able to log into the server and follow the prompts so you can connect your domain and setup DVI.

[Launch DVI Droplet At Digital Ocean](https://web.archive.org/web/20240529140031/https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/wpclouddeploy)

After navigating to the DigitalOcean droplet page with the above button, please click the **CREATE DevelopVIDeploy DROPLET** button to get the DVI image started.

When the droplet has been created you will need to **login to it via SSH to continue the setup process.**
