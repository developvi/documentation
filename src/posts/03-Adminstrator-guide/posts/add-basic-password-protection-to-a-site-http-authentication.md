You can password protect your WordPress site using something called HTTP Authentication. This is a standard method of password protecting a site on any web server. It’s simple but effective.

To do this:

*   Go to WPCloud Deploy->Applications
*   Click on the site for which this action will apply
*   Click on the _MISC_ tab
*   Scroll down to the _PASSWORD PROTECTION WITH HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION_ section
*   Fill in the USER ID and PASSWORD that will be used to protect the site
*   Click the _Basic Authentication_ toggle.
*   Click the _OK_ option on the confirmation popup

After a while the screen will refresh – if the operation is successful. If the operation fails, you’ll get a popup message.

You can see a full log of the operation under the SSH LOG screen.
