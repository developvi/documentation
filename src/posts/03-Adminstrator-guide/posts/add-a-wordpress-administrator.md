Once in a while you might find yourself locked out of a WordPress site – usually because you’ve forgotten the password for the admin. DevelopVIDeploy has a tool that you can use to quickly add an admin to the WordPress database.

*   Go to WPCloud Deploy → Applications
*   Click on the site for which this action will apply
*   Click on the **TOOLS** tab
*   Scroll down to the **ADD AN ADMINSTRATOR** section
*   Fill in the user name, password and email address for the new admin
*   Click the **Add New Admin User** button
*   Click the **OK** option on the confirmation popup

After a while the screen will refresh – if the operation is successful. If the operation fails, you’ll get a popup message.

You can see a full log of the operation under the SSH LOG screen.
